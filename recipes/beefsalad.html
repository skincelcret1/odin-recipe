    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Beef Salad</strong>, is a traditional salad made for
    <em>Easter</em> , <em>Christmas</em> and <em>New Year&#39;s Eve</em>
    . It can be served as a side dish, or a meal on its own. You can make it
    beef,turkey or chicken,potatoes, peas and lots of mayo. It&#39;s like
    a potato salad gone wild!</p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Meat - </strong> stewing beef,turkey or chicken, either
        will work. I&#39;ve never tried this with pork but pork loin would work as well</li>
        <li><strong>Veggies - </strong>potatoes,carrots and frozen peas. I usually
        use <em>Yokon Gold</em> or <em> Russets .</em>Canned peas will work as well,
        just drain them and place them in a bowl lined with paper towels to dry
        them up as much as possible. </li>
        <li><strong>Pickles - </strong> lots of pickles, this salad wouldn&#39;t 
        work without pickles.</li>
        <li><strong>Mayonnaise and mustard - </strong>lots of mayo and lots of mustard
        . You can&#39;t skip teh mustard, it will give it a nice tang that is a must
        in the salad.</li>
        <li><strong>Salt and Peper - </strong>to taste.</li>
    </ul>

    <h4><strong>Steps</strong></h4>

    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the beef : </strong>Add the beef to a pot of boiling water and cook it for about 2 hours.
        you can also use and <em>Instant Pot</em> to cook it faster. If using an <em> Instant Pot</em> cook it on high
        pressure for 35 minutes. Transfer the meat to a bowl and let it cool before chopping.</li>
        <li><strong>Cook the potatoes and carrots : </strong>Add the potatoes and carrots to a large pot and cover with water.
        Season with the tsp of salt.Bring the water to a boil and cook the potatoes and carrots until they are fork tender,should
        take about 15 minutes. Drain and cool slightly.</li>
        <li><strong>Prep the veggies and meat : </strong>Chop the meat, potatoes, carrots and pickles. They should all be small pieces
        about 1/4 inch by 1/4 inch. Drain all the juice from the diced pickles and the peas. I usually place them in a paper towel lined
        bowl to soak up all the extra liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Make the salad : </strong>Add all the veggies and meat to a big bowl, then add the mayo and mustard,season with salt and pepper
        and mix everything together. You will end up with a big bowl of salad, traditionally we smooth out the top of the salad with a knife and spread
        more mayonnaise and smooth that out.</li>
        <li><strong>Serve : </strong>Serve salad cold, do not worm it up. </li>
    </ol>
