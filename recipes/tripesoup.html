    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>The <strong>Tripe Soup</strong> is a traditional Romanian soup made with beef tripe, garlic, sour cream, eggs and vinegar. With an amazing creamy 
        texture, it&#39;s one dish that any true foodie must try.</p>
    <p>Tripe is one of those ingredients that many of us are skeptical of trying and, trust me, I was one of those people. Not only that, but I won&#39;t eat
        tripe any other way than in this soup. It&#39;s a soup I first tried in my first visit to Romania and I really fell in love with it. Since then I&#39;ve
        made it my mission to learn to make it myself by talking to all Romanian people I know and getting the recipe from them and after years and years 
        of trying, I can honestly say that my husband and I perfected it.</p>  
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Tripe - </strong>In my experience, when buying tripe in grocery stores, it already comes white and cleaned. Even so, I still like to run it
            through water and rinse it a few times.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef Bone - </strong>You don&#39;t need a big piece for this soup, just a couple small pieces, it will really flavor the broth nicely.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar - </strong>Just regular white vinegar. This is a must ingredient for this soup and I wouldn&#39;t replace it or substitute with
            anything else here.</li>
        <li><strong>Vegetables - </strong>We are going to use parsnip, carrots, onion and celery or celery root to bring some seriously delicious flavors to
            our tripe soup. I don&#39;t find celery root often in grocery stores, so I alway use celery instead.</li>
        <li><strong>Sour Cream - </strong>Aim for at least a 2% fat index in your sour cream to bring a nice creamy texture to the soup.</li>
        <li><strong>Eggs - </strong>We will be using large eggs to blend with the sour cream. This will also aid in giving the soup that creamy texture</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic - </strong>Minced fresh garlic will help bring the authentic Romanian flavor to this dish.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasoning - </strong>Salt and pepper to taste.</li>

    </ul>  
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Cook the ingredients : </strong>In a big pot, add the tripe, beef bones, carrots, celery, onion, parsnip and water.
        Bring to a boil then reduce heat to medium and cook for 2 to 3 hours or until the tripe is tender. </li>
        <li><strong>Prep the tripe and soup : </strong> Transfer the bones and the vegetables from the soup, only the tripe pieces should be left.
        Shred the boiled carrots. In a small pan add a tbsp olive and saute the carrots for 2 to 3 minutes. The carrots are what&#39;s going to
    give the soup that nice yellow color</li>
        <li><strong>Finish the soup : </strong>In a small bowl whisk the eggs with the sour cream. Add a ladle of the hot broth to the egg mixture
            and stir, repeat this another 2 or 3 times. Pour this mixture back into the soup and stir. Add the saut√©ed carrots, the minced garlic
            and the vinegar to the soup and stir. Season the soup with salt and pepper to taste. Make sure you taste it and if you require more vinegar
            feel free to add more. I prefer mine with a bit more vinegar, but this is something that each person can add to their bowl, instead of
            adding it to the whole soup, so don&#39;t over do it. </li>
        <li><strong>Serve : </strong> Garnish with parsley and serve hot with additional sour cream and hot peppers such as red chilies whether
            pickled or fresh.</li>    
    </ol>
