    <h2><strong>Description</strong></h2>
    <p>In <em>Romania</em>, in almost each restaurant you visit, you can find
    at least 3 types of <strong>ciorba</strong> in the menu.<strong>Ciorba</strong>
    is usually a sour soup containing various vegetables and meat.We prepare
    <strong>ciorba</strong> with chicken, pork,veal,turkey,even fish,
    accompanied by all kinds of vegetables. The sour taste is usually
    given by <em>bors</em>, a liquid ingredient made of wheat fermented in water.
    Sometimes,we use lemon to give soups a sour taste, just like I did with this 
    sour chicken soup with garlic and cream.</p>
    <p>I used both chicken breast and chicken thighs for this recipe.
        The thighs contain more <strong>fat</strong>, which makes your
        soup even more delicious than it whould be with just plain chicken
        breast. Even so, if you prefer to cut some calories, you can just 
        one chicken breast.
    </p>

    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Chicken breast</li>
        <li>2 Chicken thighs</li>
        <li>3 Carrots</li>
        <li>1 Celery root</li>
        <li>1 Parsnip</li>
        <li>1 Onion</li>
        <li>4 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 Egg yolks</li>
        <li>230 grams (1 cup) sour cream</li>
        <li>Juice from 1 lemon</li>
        <li>1 Parsley bunch</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>In a soup pot, add 3 or 4 litres of water and the chicken parts.
            The water amount depends on your soup pot size. Boil for at least 1
            hours, skimming the foam each time it rises to the surface.
        </li>
        <li>Add the carrots, celery root, parsnip, onion, and boil 
            for 30-45 minutes, or until the vegetables are cooked.
        </li>
        <li>Remove the vegetables and the meat from the pot. Discard the
            onion and the parsnip. Shred the carrots and teh celery toot with
            a grater, and chop the chicken meat into pieces. Put the vegetables
            and meat back in the pot.
        </li>
        <li>Put 2 ladles of soup in a bowl and let them cool for 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>In another bowl, beat the egg yolks and mix with the sour cream.
            Press the garlic and add it to the cream mixture. Gradually add the
            2 ladles of soup and whisk well. This with help temper the sour cream mixture,
            so that it won't curdle.
        </li>
        <li>Add the lemon juice, salt and pepper to taste, and let the soup boil 
            for another 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Turn off the heat, then add the sour cream mixture while stirring
             continuously with a whisk.
        </li>
